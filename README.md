Yoo, hey man, I basically got sidetracked with going back to old code, and fixing bugs due to outdated keys, reformatting my code, etc. As you can see, I at least did create the repository for the project. I kinda plan to have different folders for different components of the website. Rn i have created the communication/authentication component, which contains the code for sending emails & text messages through code. There's things to work on still, but it at least works. I did hide my .env file which contains the actual strings for each variable, I can show how to set that file up if you want. But I just basically followed instructions from Twilio for text messages, & SendGrid for emails. You could sign up if you want, they're free, you would only need to create a .env file where you can put all your keys, tokens, etc. in.
(For example:
export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY/TOKEN'
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='YOUR_SID_TOKEN/KEY'

You only need to add what you need from the files. Idk if it makes sense lol)

I guess the best workflow we could use is one where we can outline tasks, what needs to be done, and we assign ourselves to what we want to do first. I'll try to create a list soon, sometime this weekend. & at that point we can try to get started. I of course need to brush up my skills again, I haven't coded in a couple of months, so I'm a lil rusty lol. I'll also outline what technologies we'll use, & if you have any suggestions about what you'd like to use as well, I'm more than open to hearing about it.
Anyway, my discord name is manuellperez#0071
